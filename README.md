# Indicators

Indicators is a Julia package offering efficient implementations of many technical analysis indicators and algorithms. This work is inspired by the [TTR](https://github.com/joshuaulrich/TTR) package in R and the Python implementation of [TA-Lib](https://github.com/mrjbq7/ta-lib), and the ultimate goal is to implement all of the functionality of these offerings (and more) in Julia.

# Implemented
## Moving Averages
- SMA (simple moving average)
- WMA (weighted moving average)
- EMA (exponential moving average)
- TRIMA (triangular moving average)
- MAMA (MESA adaptive moving average, developed by John Ehlers)
- HMA (Hull moving average)
- SWMA (sine-weighted moving average)

## Momentum Indicators
- MACD (moving average convergence-divergence)
- RSI (relative strength index)
- ADX (average directional index)

## Volatility Indicators
- Bollinger Bands
- Average True Range
